# CarBot
An application that calculates your carbon emissions based on average data from consumption values ​​and on each page it gives you advice on the type of consumption on that page. The application does not have a clean architecture and clean codes yet. Since it is a small project, I preferred to keep it that way, maybe I will add them later
